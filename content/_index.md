# Hi! I'm Adam Hammes.

I'm an American software developer, currently living in Quebec City. I
graduated Cum Laude from Iowa State University with a Bachelor of Science in
Computer Science. My professional experience includes working at
[Workiva](https://www.workiva.com/) and
[nventive](https://nventive.com/fr/); I led the frontend redesign of the
[Alfa Romeo Build &amp; Price.](https://www.alfaromeo.ca/en/build-and-price/)

In my free time, I enjoy playing piano and swing dancing.
