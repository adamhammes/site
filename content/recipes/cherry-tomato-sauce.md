## Ingredients

- 1 pound (450 g) dry pasta
- Kosher salt
- 4 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 6 tablespoons (90ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 1/2 pounds cherry tomatoes (about 2 pints; 675g)
- 1 ounce fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped (about 1 cup; 30 g)
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Parmesan cheese, for serving

## Directions

Directions

1. Place pasta in a large skillet or saut√© pan and cover with water and a big pinch of salt.
   Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally.
   Boil until just shy of al dente, about 1 minute less than the package instructions recommend.
1. Meanwhile, heat garlic and 4 tablespoons (60ml) olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently, until garlic is softened but not browned, about 3 minutes.
   Add tomatoes and cook, stirring, until tomatoes begin to burst, about 10 minutes.
   You can help them along by pressing on them with the back of a wooden spoon as they soften.
1. Continue to cook until sauce is rich and creamy, about 5 minutes longer.
   Stir in basil and season to taste with salt and pepper.
1. When pasta is cooked, drain, reserving 1 cup (240ml) pasta water.
   Add pasta to sauce and increase heat to medium-high.
   Cook, stirring and tossing constantly and adding reserved pasta water as necessary to adjust consistency to a nice, creamy flow.
   Remove from heat, stir in remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, and grate in a generous shower of Parmesan cheese.
   Serve immediately, passing extra Parmesan at the table.
