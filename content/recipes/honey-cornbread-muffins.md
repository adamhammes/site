## Ingredients

- 1 cup yellow cornmeal
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tbsp baking powder
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup whole milk
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 stick butter, melted
- 1/4 cup honey
- 12 paper muffin cups
- 12-cup muffin tin

## Directions

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Into a large bowl, mix the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.
In another bowl, whisk together the whole milk, eggs, butter, and honey.
Add the wet to the dry ingredients and stir until just mixed.

Place muffin paper liners in a 12-cup muffin tin.
Evenly divide the cornbread mixture into the papers.
Bake for 15 minutes, until golden.

## Notes

Spraying the muffin wrappers with cooking spray will make it easier to extract the muffins after baking.

To melt the butter, microwave in a microwave-safe bowl for fifteen-second intervals until completely liquid, whisking in between intervals.
