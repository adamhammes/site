## Ingredients

- 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs (2 lb)
- 10g salt
- 3g msg (optional)
- the juice of 1/2 lime
- 2g cumin
- 1g kashmiri chili powder
- 3g turmeric powder
- 5g black pepper
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1" knob of ginger, crushed
- 10g tomato paste
- 50g yogurt

For the roll:

- 4-6 paratha flatbreads
- Cucumbers, sliced
- Pickled onions
- 1 egg per wrap, beaten
- A sauce such as [chimichurri](@/recipes/chimichurri.md)

## Directions

Chicken

1. Add the peeled garlic cloves and knob of ginger to a mortar and pestle and bash into a rough paste.
1. Cut the chicken into small cubes and add them to a large mixing bowl along with the salt, msg (if using), lime juice, ground cumin, chili powder, turmeric, black pepper, garlic, ginger, tomato paste, and plain yogurt. Mix well and coat every piece.
1. Cover and marinate in the fridge for at least an hour or up to overnight for best results.
1. Set the oven on broil over high.
   Get out a baking sheet and evenly space the chicken so none of the pieces are touching, this will help with even cooking and better browning. Place under the broiler and cook for about 8 to 10 minutes during which some charred pieces should develop.
1. Take them out and flip with a spatula once before cooking for another couple of minutes. Then set aside.

Assembly

1. Place a frozen or fresh-made paratha and gently cook until golden brown and crispy on both sides.

   Note: If you want to make it an egg roll, scramble one egg and pour it on one side of the golden brown paratha.

1. Flip once and cook the egg face down, then remove from the pan.
1. Spread a spoonful or two of the sauce on the bottom followed by a serving of the chicken. Garnish with pickled onions, thinly sliced cucumber, and more sauce as needed.
1. Optionally wrap up with foil or parchment paper to keep the fillings contained. Repeat with remaining kati rolls.
