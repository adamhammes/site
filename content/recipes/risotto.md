## Ingredients

- 16 oz (1/2 kilo) mushrooms
- 1 onion
- 1-2 carrots
- 1-2 celery stalks
- 1-2 shallots
- 4-6 cloves of garlic
- 1 cup (200g) risotto rice
- butter
- cognac (or white wine, or water/stock + a little balsamic vinegar)
- parmesan or pecorino cheese (or vegan sour cream instead of cheese and butter)
- olive oil
- chives
- salt
- pepper

## Directions

1. Pull the stems out of all the mushrooms and wash the stems, if necessary.
   In a large sauce pan, fry the stems in olive oil until thoroughly browned.
   Roughly chop the onion, carrots and celery, and put them in with the stems.
   Cook the vegetables until they're starting to brown, stirring constantly.
   Cover everything in water and simmer for about two hours. Strain, discard the
   solids, and season the stock with salt (and/or MSG) to taste.

1. Slice the mushroom caps into big chunks. Finely chop the shallots and
   garlic. In a wide pan, start heating a big knob of butter and a glug of olive
   oil. Put in the mushrooms and saut√© until most of their water has come out
   and evaporated and the mushrooms are thoroughly browned.

1. Push the mushrooms to the rim of the pan and dump the shallots in the
   center. Stir and fry the shallots for a moment, then dump in the garlic and
   stir to combine everything in the pan. Make another well in the center of the
   pan then dump in the rice. Stir the rice and let it brown for a moment, then
   stir to combine everything in the pan.

1. If using cognac or wine, deglaze with a big splash of it now. If not,
   deglaze with water/stock and put in a little glug of balsamic vinegar. Then
   add enough stock to more than cover the rice, and let it simmer aggressively
   until absorbed, stirring occasionally.

1. Then start adding additional stock in small doses and stirring constantly
   until the rice is almost cooked (which you should test by tasting). If you
   run out of your mushroom stock, just use water. When the rice is almost
   cooked, turn the heat off and stir in a big knob of butter and a big pile of
   grated cheese (or vegan sour cream instead of butter and cheese), and black
   pepper and additional salt to taste.

1. Serve and top with fresh chopped chives.
