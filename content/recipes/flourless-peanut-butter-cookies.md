## Ingredients

* 1 cup smooth peanut butter
* 3/4 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* Pinch of salt
* 1 large egg
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup chocolate chips

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 Â°F.

2. Beat the peanut butter, sugar, baking soda, and salt together until well-blended.

3. Add the egg and vanilla and mix until incorporated.

4. Stir in the chocolate chips.

5. Scoop the dough by the tablespoonful onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and push the top of the dough to flatten just slightly.

6. Bake the cookies for 8 to 10 minutes.
Remove from the oven just before they begin to brown on the edges, and allow to cool on the pan.
