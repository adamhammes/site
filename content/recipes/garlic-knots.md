## Ingredients

Homemade Dough

- 1 and 1/3 cups (320ml) warm water (between 100–110°F, 38–43°C)
- 2 and 1/4 teaspoons (7g) instant yeast (1 standard packet)
- 1 Tablespoon (13g) granulated sugar
- 3 Tablespoons (45ml) olive oil or (43g) melted butter
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 3 and 1/2 cups (about 450g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled), plus more for hands and work surface

Topping

- 5 Tablespoons (71g) unsalted butter, melted
- 3 garlic cloves, minced; or 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- optional after baking: 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- optional after baking: 2 Tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Instructions

1. Whisk the warm water, yeast, and granulated sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment.
   Cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes.

   If you don’t have a stand mixer, simply use a large mixing bowl and mix the dough with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula in the next step.

1. Add the olive oil (or butter), salt, garlic powder, and half of the flour.
   Beat for 15 seconds, then add the remaining flour.
   Beat on low speed for 2 minutes.

1. Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer (and switch to the dough hook if using the paddle) and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes.
   If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough.
   Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough.
   After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft.
   Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise.

   You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it.
   Hold it up to a window or light.
   Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first?
   If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise.
   If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test.

1. Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray—just use the same bowl you used for the dough.
   Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil.
   Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel.
   Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 1–2 hours or until double in size.

   Tip: For a warm environment on a particularly cold day, heat your oven to 150°F (66°C).
   Turn the oven off, place the dough inside, and keep the door slightly ajar.
   This will be a warm environment for your dough to rise.
   After about 30 minutes, close the oven door to trap the air inside with the rising dough.
   When it’s doubled in size, remove from the oven.

1. Tear off 50 gram chunks of dough.
   Tie each into a knot.
   You can tuck the 2 ends of the knots underneath or leave them out—that’s up to you.
   Arrange the knots on 2 baking sheets lined with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.
1. Lightly cover the shaped knots and let them rest for at least 30 minutes and up to 45 minutes. They will slightly puff up during this time, producing softer rolls.
1. Towards the end of the rise time, preheat oven to 400°F (204°).
1. Make the topping: Stir the melted butter, garlic, Italian seasoning, and salt together.
   Brush on the knots. Reserve some of the topping for when the knots come out of the oven.
1. Bake for about 20–23 minutes or until golden brown on top.
   Remove from the oven and brush the warm knots with remaining garlic butter.
   Sprinkle with parmesan cheese and/or parsley, if using.
1. Serve plain or with marinara sauce for dipping.
1. Cover and store leftover knots at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
   Freeze baked and cooled knots for up to 3 months.
   Thaw on the counter, then reheat as desired.
