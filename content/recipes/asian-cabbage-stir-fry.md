Cook until the beef is browned.

2. Add the cabbage and (optionally) the carrots. 
Cook/stir until the cabbage starts to wilt.

3. Stir in the sauce and (optionally) the green onions.

## Tips

In order to minimize downtime, I usually do the ingredient prep/cooking in the following order:

1. Mince the garlic/ginger

2. Start cooking the beef/garlic/ginger

3. Shred the cabbage/carrots

4. Add the cabbage/carrots once the beef is browned

5. Mix up the sauce

6. Add the sauce

7. Add the garnishes
