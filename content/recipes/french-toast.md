## Ingredients

- 1 cup half-and-half
- 3 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 12 (1/2 inch) slices day-old or stale country loaf
- Butter to grease pan

## Directions

1. In a medium-size mixing bowl, whisk together the half-and-half, eggs, honey, and salt.
   This may be done the night before.

2. Preheat oven to 375Â° F.

3. Dip the slices of bread into the custard and allow to soak for 30 seconds on each side.
   Move the slices to a wire rack on a cooling pan and allow to sit.

4. Over medium-low heat, grease a 10-inch nonstick saute pan with better.
   Place 2 slices of bread at a time into the pan and cook until golden brown, approximately 2 to 3 minutes per side.
   Put the slices on a wire rack over a pan when done and allow to rest for 2 more minutes.

5. In the pre-heated oven, bake the slices on a rack for five minutes.
   Serve immediately.
