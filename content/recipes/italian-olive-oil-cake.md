## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 3 large eggs
- 1 ¾ cups white sugar
- 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing
- 1 cup whole milk
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 tablespoons freshly grated orange zest (2 oranges)
- 1 tablespoon powdered sugar for dusting (Optional)

## Directions

1. Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
1. Line the bottom of a springform pan with a round piece of parchment paper and generously grease with olive oil. Grease the sides of the pan with olive oil as well.
1. Combine flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a bowl; whisk together until evenly combined.
1. Combine eggs, sugar, olive oil, milk, honey, and orange zest in a second bowl. Starting slowly at first, whisk together until mixture is smooth. Stir in flour mixture until everything is just mixed together and flour has disappeared. Do not overmix.
1. Pour batter into the prepared pan and tap pan a few times against the work surface to remove any air bubbles.
1. Bake in the preheated oven until the cake is browned on the surface and a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes. Make sure to not overbake.
1. Transfer cake to a wire rack and allow to cool for 30 minutes. Loosen edge of the cake by running a knife around the sides of the pan. Remove from the pan and allow to cool completely, another 30 minutes. Dust with powdered sugar if desired.
