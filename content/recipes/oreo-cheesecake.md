Dark Chocolate Ganache:

- 2 tablespoons finely chopped semisweet chocolate (20g)
- 1 tablespoon heavy cream

Whipped Cream:

- 1 cup heavy whipping cream cold (240mL)
- ¼ cup powdered sugar (30g)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Assembly:

- 7 Oreos

## Directions

Crust

1. Preheat the oven to 350º F
1. Add 26 Oreos to a food processor and pulse until you have mostly fine crumbs.
   Drizzle in the melted butter while pulsing, then remove the blade and use a spatula to mix in any butter settled at the bottom.
   If you’re doing this by hand, place the Oreos in a sealed plastic bag and crush them using a rolling pin.
   Then, mix with melted butter in a bowl.
1. Transfer the Oreo mixture to a springform pan and distribute evenly with a spatula.
   Use a large glass or measuring cup to press the mixture into the bottom of the pan and create a firm crust. Chill the crust for a few minutes in the freezer while the oven reaches 350ºF, then bake for about 10 minutes. Remove and set aside.

Filling

1. Pre-heat your oven to 350º F
1. Chop about 12 Oreos into quarters, or just give them a rough chop.
   Crush another 12-16 Oreos in your food processor or a large bag and set aside.
1. In a bowl, mix together the sour cream, vainlla, and flour with a fork.
1. Add the room-temperature cream cheese and sugar to the bowl of your stand mixer fitter with a whisk.
   Beat until smooth.
   You can make the batter with a hand electric mixer instead; just make sure to use a large bowl so things don’t become precarious.
1. Once the batter is smooth and without lumps like you see in the photo above it’s time to scrape the bowl down!
   This is an important step because a uniform consistency will help your cheesecake bake properly.
1. Beat in the sour cream cream mix and scrape the bowl down again, then beat once more until smooth.
1. Add the eggs and yolk one at a time while the mixer is running on a medium speed.
   Beat until smooth.
1. Pour in the Oreo crumbs and fold into the batter scraping that bowl down as you go.
1. For maximum Oreo flavor, we add chunks of the cookies in layers.
   Pour about a third of the batter into your crust then smooth it to the edge and sprinkle in some of the quartered Oreos.
1. Pour in another third of the batter, then more cookies, and finally, top off with the remaining batter.
   Smooth it out a bit, then place on a baking sheet and pop into the preheated oven at 350º F for 10 minutes.
   Reduce the oven temperature to 300º F and bake for another 60 minutes.
   The center will still jiggle, but the edge will be set.
   Turn the oven off and leave the cheesecake inside for 30 minutes.
   Then, remove the cheesecake and allow it to cool completely to room temperature before chilling.
1. For best results, I suggest chilling the cheesecake overnight for the best results, but you can get away with three hours if you’re in a hurry. Once chilled, remove the cheesecake from the springform pan and place it on a cake stand.

Ganache

1. Make two batches of ganache: one white and one dark chocolate.
   The dark chocolate batch is quite small, so it’s easiest to microwave the chocolate in short bursts at 50% power, then pour in the warm cream and mix until smooth.
   You can make the white chocolate the same way or in a double boiler.
   Pour the white chocolate ganache onto the chilled cake, then add spoonfuls of the dark chocolate.
1. Use a skewer or small knife to swirl the chocolate and create a pleasing pattern.
   Try not to over-mix, as it will start to look “muddy”.
   Place the cheesecake in the fridge to chill while you make the whipped cream.

Whipped Cream:

1. Add the cold cream, powdered sugar, vanilla to the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and beat on high until soft peaks form.
   It’s best to use a cold bowl and whisk straight out of the freezer but room temperature works too.
1. Transfer whipped cream to a piping bag fitted with a large closed star tip and pipe the edge of the cake in a tight corkscrew pattern.
   Cut 7 Oreos in half and place in the whipped cream straight side down.
