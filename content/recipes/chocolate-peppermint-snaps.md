## Ingredients

* 3/4 cup (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1 teaspon vanilla extract
* 1 teaspoon peppermint extract, or 1/8 teaspoon peppermint oil (or to taste)
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/4 cup cocoa powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets.

2. In a medium bowl, beat together the butter and sugars.

3. Add the egg, beating well and scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl.

4. Add the vanilla and peppermint, beating to combine. Taste the dough; add more peppermint, if desired.

5. In a separate bowl, add the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt, beating to combine.

6. Add the wet to the dry ingredients and beat to combine.

7. Stir in the chocolate chips.

8. Drop a few generous 1/2 tablespoons full of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 1 1/2" to 2" apart.
Since these cookies are dark-colored, it's difficult to tell when they're done.
I suggest you bake 2 or 3 cookies alone first, before baking a couple of baking sheets' worth.
That way, you can make sure you bake them to just the right degree of doneness.

9. Bake the cookies about 9 minutes (if they're on parchment-lined baking sheets); bake for a slightly shorter time if they're on dark sheets without parchment.
Remove them from the oven, and transfer them to a rack to cool.

10. Bake the remainder of the cookies, letting them cool right on the pans, or transferring to a rack if you need the pans.

11. Wrap airtight, and store at room temperature.
These cookies are sensitive to humidity; if they're crunchy, they'll quickly soften during humid weather, if not wrapped securely.

Yield: About 70 small cookies.
