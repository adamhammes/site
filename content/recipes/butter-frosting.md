## Ingredients

- 6 tbsp butter
- 4 1/2 cups sifted confectioners' sugar (approximate)

- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp almond extract
- Food coloring (optional)

## Directions

1. In a bowl beat butter or margarine until fluffy.
2. Gradually add 2 cups of the sugar, beating well.
3. Beat in the milk, vanilla, and almond
4. Alternate adding sugar and beating until a good spreading consistency is reached.
