## Ingredients

- Two sticks (227 grams) of unsalted butter
- 2-3 tsp vanilla extract
- 454 grams powdered sugar
- 3.5 grams salt
- 1-2 tablespoons milk, as needed

## Directions

1. Add the “slightly softened” butter (somewhere in between straight out of the refrigerator and room temperature) to the mixing bowl along with the vanilla extract.
1. Mix the butter and vanilla together until they are fully combined, about 2 minutes on medium speed.
   You want the vanilla to fully meld with the butter to get the best-flavored frosting possible.
1. Scrape the sides of the bowl down before moving on to the next step of the recipe.
1. Measure 1 pound of powdered sugar.
1. Add the powdered sugar to the mixing bowl.
1. Start your mixer (or electric beater) on the lowest setting.
   Keep on low until the butter and sugar are incorporated (about 30 seconds).
   Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
   Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and mix for 30-45 more seconds until the frosting starts to be light and fluffy.
1. If the frosting is still dry or crumbly, add 1 teaspoon of milk and mix again.
1. Taste your frosting!
   You are trying to determine if the consistency is correct or if it needs a tiny bit more vanilla extract.
   Depending on how it tastes, you will take the next step.
   If the frosting has the right taste but is too thick, add some milk and mix again to check to see if it is now the right consistency.
   How much milk? That depends on the state of your frosting.
   A good rule of thumb is to add the milk a teaspoon at a time.
