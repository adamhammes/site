## Ingredients

* 1 15 oz. can black beans
* 1 cup frozen corn kernels
* 1/2 small red onion
* 1 clove garlic
* 1/4 bunch fresh cilantro
* 2 cups shredded cheese
* 1 batch taco seasoning
* 10 taco-sized tortillas

## Directions

1. Drain the can of beans and rinse lightly.
Place the beans in a large bowl along with the corn (no need to thaw).

2. Rinse the cilantro, remove the leaves, and chop roughly.
Dice the onion and mince the garlic.
Add the cilantro, onion, garlic, taco seasononing, and shredded cheese to the bowl with the beans and corn.
Stir until evenly mixed.

3. Place a half cup of the filling on one side of each tortilla and fold over.
Cook in a skillet on both sides over medium heat until brown and crispy and the cheesy filling has melted.

4. To freeze the quesadillas, fill each one and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Place in the freezer for one hour to solidify the quesadillas and then transfer to a freezer bag.
To reheat, either microwave (for a soft quesadilla) or cook in a skillet on low heat.
