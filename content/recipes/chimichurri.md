## Ingredients

- 1 bunch of parsley, minced
- 75g extra virgin olive oil
- 25g red wine vinegar
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- a sprinkle of dried oregano
- a sprinkle of red pepper flakes
- a few cranks of black pepper
- salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Finely chop the parsley and mince the garlic. Gather all remaining ingredients.
1. Add parsley and garlic to a bowl, then add the olive oil and red wine vinegar, which should barely submerge the mixture. If you want a looser consistency, add a bit more oil and vinegar. Sprinkle in the dried oregano, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper.
1. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Enjoy over everything.

## Notes

When scaling up the recipe, maintain a 3:1 ratio of oil to vinegar.
