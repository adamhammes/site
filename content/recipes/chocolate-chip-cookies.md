## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt (or 3/4 teaspoon of fine table salt)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 sticks (1 cup) very soft unsalted butter (be sure the butter is room temp, and very, very soft!)
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup light brown sugar
- 1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 large egg
- 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

## Directions

1. Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. In a separate bowl, cream the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together until mixture is light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the egg, milk, and vanilla extract. Whisk liquids together in small areas around the bowl, then all together to avoid separation.
1. Pour dry ingredients into the wet ingredients; stir until flour is thoroughly mixed in. Stir in the chocolate chips.
1. Transfer dough to a resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate until dough is firm, at least 2 hours.
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheet with parchment paper.
1. Scoop out rounded tablespoons of dough and place on prepared baking sheet, leaving 4 inches of space between cookies (about 8 per sheet). Bake in preheated oven until cookies are golden brown, about 12 minutes. Slide parchment and cookies onto a cooling rack for a few minutes. Remove parchment and finish cooling the cookies on the rack.

## Notes

- If you don't have kosher salt, use 3/4 teaspoon of fine table salt instead of 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher.
