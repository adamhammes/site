## Ingredients

(for 6 small portions)

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 large onion, diced
- large handful of sliced mushrooms
- 1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
- 1 cup diced red bell peppers
- 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and sliced
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne
- 28-oz can (about 3 cups) crushed San Marzano tomatoes, or other high-quality plum tomatoes.
- 1/2 cup water or broth, or as needed
- 1 egg per portion (or 2 if main course)

For serving (optional):

- toast
- crumbled feta cheese and fresh parsley to finish

## Directions

1. To a large, heavy skillet on medium-high heat add the olive oil, onions, mushrooms, and salt.
   Cook for 10 minutes, or until the mushrooms release their moisture and start to brown.

2. Add the bell pepper and jalapenos.
   Cook for five minutes to let the peppers soften a bit.
   Stir in the spices and cook for two more minutes to allow them to infuse the oil.

3. Add the tomatos and a splash of water/broth. Simmer on medium heat for 15-20 minutes.

4. Using a spoon, make a shallow egg-shaped depression in the mixture for each egg.
   Crack the eggs one at a time into a separate bowl, and then place them in the prepared mixtures.
   Season with salt and pepper.

5. Cover the pan and allow the egg yolks to firm up.
   Take the shakshuka off the heat slightly before the eggs are done, as the residual heat will continue to cook them.
   Sprinkle on the feta cheese and parsley.

6. To serve: layer sauce, egg, then sauce again in a bowl alongside a slice of toast.
