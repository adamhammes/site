## Ingredients

- 2 tsp unflavored oil
- 1/2 cup popcorn kernels
- 4 tbsp (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
- 3 tbsp honey
- 1 tsp kosher salt

## Directions

1. Place the oil and three popcorn kernels in a large pot.
   Cover and heat over medium heat until all three kernels have popped.
   Pour in the remaining kernels, cover the pot again, and shake to distribute.
   As the popcorn pops, shake occasionally.
   Immediately remove from heat once the popping slows to two or three seconds between pops.

2. Pour the popcorn into a large bowl, removing any unpopped or partially popped kernels.

3. Melt the butter in a frying pan over medium heat.
   Swirl occasionally.
   As the butter melts, it will begin to foam and the color will progress from lemony-yellow to golden-tan to a toasty-brown.
   Once you start smelling a nutty aroma, take the pan off the heat and scrape the butter (including any brown bits) into a heatproof bowl.

4. Add the honey and salt to the butter and stir continuously until well-mixed.
   Drizzle the mixture over the popcorn and stir until the popcorn is well-coated.
