## Ingredients

* 4 lb bone-in skin-on chicken thighs
* 3 russet potatoes, quartered and peeled
* 1 tbsp kosher salt
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 1 tsp dried rosemary
* 1 rounded tbsp dried oregano
* Pinch of cayenne
* 6 cloves of garlic, freshly minced
* 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (approximately 3 lemons)
* 1/2 cup olive oil
* 2/3 cup chicken broth (for deglazing)
* Freshly chopped oregano to garnish

## Directions

1. Put the chicken into a mixing bowl.
Season with salt, pepper, rosemary, oregano, cayenne, and garlic.
Add the lemon juice, oil, and potatoes and mix thoroughly by hand.
Cover and sit in fridge for a few hours (or use immediately).

2. Transfer the mixture into a lightly-oiled large roasting pan, making sure that the chicken is evenly distributed and skin-side up.
Add a 1/2 cup of water or chicken broth.
Spoon the remaining marinade over the chicken and potatoes.

3. Transfer the pan into the center of a 425 Â°F oven and cook for 45 minutes.
At the 15 and 30 minutes, remove the pan and toss the potatoes/chicken in the pan drippings with a pair of tongs.
Make sure that the chicken goes back into the oven skin-side up.

4. After 45 minutes, take the pan out of the oven and put the chicken pieces on another plate/pan.
Cover them to keep warm.
Turn the oven to broil/hottest, toss the potatoes in the drippings one last time, and put the pan back in the oven to crisp up the potatoes (~5 minutes).

5. Remove the pan one last time, splash with the remaining water/chicken broth, strain the left-over liquid, and spoon over the chicken and potatoes.

6. Garnish with freshly chopped oregano (optional).
