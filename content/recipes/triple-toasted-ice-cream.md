Recipe taken from [Day With Mei](https://www.daywithmei.com/triple-toasted-vanilla-ice-cream/).

## Ingredients

- 1 vanilla bean sub 2 teaspoons vanilla extract and skip toasting
- 90g granulated sugar split into 50g + 40g
- 350mL heavy cream
- 325mL whole milk
- 80g egg yolks from 4 large eggs
- 30g dextrose powder (sub 40g light corn syrup OR 40g granulated sugar)
- 30g skim milk powder
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1.5 grams
- 1g locust bean gum (optional, for texture)

Instructions

1. Tip the milk powder into a cold skillet and set over medium low heat.
   Cook until a golden brown graham cracker color, about 5 minutes.
   It’s normal for the milk powder to clump, so you’ll want to stir constantly to break up clumps and for even toasting.
   Once the desired color is reached, tip it out on to a plate to halt carry over cooking.
1. Toast the vanilla bean with a pair of tongs over a medium gas flame or with a blowtorch.
   Pass the bean over the flame until it becomes fragrant and just starts to char.
   Look for it to puff up and become shiny when it’s done.
   This should only take a couple of minutes.
   Set aside to cool.
1. If you don’t have a gas stove, you can also heat up a dry cast iron or sauté pan on high until ripping hot.
   Press the vanilla bean against the pan for maximum surface area contact.
1. Use a paring knife to split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise.
   Use the back of the knife to scrape out the black flecks from inside the vanilla bean.
   Reserve both the vanilla pod and flecks.
1. Add 40 g sugar, whole milk, dextrose powder, egg yolks, milk powder, vanilla flecks, salt, and locust bean gum (if using) to a blender.
   Pulse until the mixture is smooth and the egg yolks are fully dispersed.
1. If using an immersion blender, skip this step and simply add the ingredients directly to the saucepan after combining the caramel and heavy cream.
   Blend directly in the pan (with the heat off) until smooth and egg yolks are fully dispersed.
1. Set a saucepan (ideally at least 3 quarts/3.5L) over medium heat and add 50g sugar to the dry pan in an even layer.
   Do not stir or disturb the sugar; allow it to start melting around the edges.
   Once the mixture begins to melt, gently push the liquid sugar around the edges towards the center of the pan.
   Continue doing so until all the sugar is melted and becomes a golden brown color (again, looking for a graham cracker color).
1. Slowly drizzle in heavy cream to halt further caramelization.
   Take caution: it will sputter and steam. Bring the mixture to a simmer and stir with a spatula to dissolve.
   If small shards of caramel remain, don't fret, they will dissolve as the mixture continues to cook.
1. Add in the blended egg yolk mixture and vanilla pods.
   Continue cooking over medium heat until the mixture reaches 180F, or until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.
   Stir frequently to prevent scorching.
1. Take the pan off heat and cover with a lid to steep for 20 minutes.
1. Prepare an ice bath in a large container with equal parts ice and water.
   Transfer the cooked ice cream base to a heatproof container.
   Place heatproof container in the ice bath to cool.
   Once cool, cover and set in the fridge overnight, ideally at least 8 hours to develop body and flavor.
1. Fish out and discard the spent vanilla pods.
   Pour the chilled mixture into your ice cream machine and spin according to machine directions.
   The ice cream should be a soft-serve consistency when done.
   Transfer to an airtight container and place it in the freezer for at least 4 hours to fully firm up.
1. To serve, allow the ice cream to thaw slightly at room temperature for a few minutes for easier scooping.
