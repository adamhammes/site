Recipe taken from [https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-chocolate-chip-cookies/](https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-chocolate-chip-cookies/)

Ingredients

- 1 tbsp (7 grams) ground flaxseed
- 2.5 tbsp (37 ml) water
- 1/2 cup (113 grams) vegan butter, softened to room temperature
- 1 1/4 cup (185 grams) brown sugar, lightly packed (use cane sugar + 2 tbsp molasses as a substitute)
- 2 tsp (10 ml) pure vanilla extract
- 188 g all purpose flour
- 2 tsp cornstarch
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 1/4 cup (225 grams) non-dairy chocolate chips or chunks

Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line two cookie sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats (or spray with oil.)
1. Mix the ground flaxseed and water in a small bowl and set aside to make your flax egg.
1. In a large bowl using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the softened vegan butter and brown sugar for 1-2 minutes until creamy.
1. Add the vanilla and the flax egg and mix to combine.
1. Next, stop the mixer and add the flour.
   Sprinkle the cornstarch, baking soda and salt on top of the flour.
   Turn the mixer on low speed, and mix until just combined.
1. Add in the chocolate chips to incorporate, either by hand or using the mixer.
1. Roll the dough into balls, 20 grams each.
   Place on the prepared pans and bake for 8 minutes, until they are barely golden around the edges.
   Do not over bake!
   They will be puffy and lightly colored.
1. Let cool on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack.
   The cookies will firm up as they cool, and become the most perfect chewy cookies ever!
   Enjoy.
