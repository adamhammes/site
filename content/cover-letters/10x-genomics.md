10x Genomics
<br>
Pleasonton, CA

Dear Hiring Manager,

It is with genuine enthusiasm that I submit my application for the position of front-end software engineer at 10x Genomics.
As a front-end developer with close to four years of professional experience, I know that my diverse skill set will make me an asset to the team.

I believe that software development is fundamentally a process of sharing knowledge.
At Nventive, I popularized the use of Storybook for developing and documenting our React components.
In doing so, I worked closely with the team's designer to learn the logic behind his designs.
In return, I taught him the capabilities and limitations of CSS.
This type of tight collaboration is what I hope to bring to my time at 10x Genomics.

Web fundamentals (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) are essential to being a productive front-end developer.
Understanding how frameworks work under the hood is key to using them correctly, and I can not count the number of times two lines of CSS has saved me 30 lines of Javascript.
At the same time, I am quick to learn new tools as they present themselves.
I begin all of my professional projects the same way: Installing Typescript and enabling strict mode.

"Mastering biology to advance human health."
10x Genomics's mission statement is undeniably noble, and I am excited at the opportunity to work towards realizing it.
I appreciate your consideration and look forward to hearing from you.

Warmest regards,

Adam Hammes
