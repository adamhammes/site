10x Genomics
<br>
Pleasonton, CA

Dear Hiring Manager,

It is with genuine enthusiasm that I submit my application for the position of front-end software engineer at 10x Genomics.
As a front-end developer with close to four years of professional experience, I know that my diverse skill set will make me an asset to the team.

I believe that software development is fundamentally a process of sharing knowledge.
That's why in my time at nventive, I popularized the use of Storybook for developing and documenting our React components.
At the same time, I worked closely with the team's designer to learn the "logic" behind his designs, as well as to teach him what could and couldn't be easily done with CSS.
This type of tight collaboration is what I hope to bring to my time at 10x Genomics.

A tenet I hold dear is that web fundamentals (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) are the key to being a productive front-end developer.
Understanding how frameworks work under the hood is key to using them correctly, and I can't count the number of times two lines of CSS has saved me 30 lines of Javascript.
At the same time, I'm not afraid to adopt new tools as they present themselves.
Every front-end project that I have started at work beings the same way: Installing Typescript and enabling strict mode.

"Mastering biology to advance human health."
10x Genomics's mission statement is undeniably noble, and I am excited at the opportunity to work towards realizing it.
I appreciate your consideration and look forward to hearing from you.

Warmest regards,

Adam Hammes
