Dear Hiring Manager,

It is with genuine enthusiasm that I submit my application for the position of frontend software engineer at the Center for Translational Data Science.
As a frontend web developer with close to four years of professional experience, I know that my diverse skill set will make me an asset to the team.

As a frontend developer, every project I work on uses Javascript to some degree, and I have enjoyed exploring and learning the language.
I have used Chrome's performance profiler to optimize slow single-page applications.
In projects that had high accessibility needs, I have taken great pleasure in implementing accessible modals and other components using vanilla Javascript.

In my time at nventive, I have worked on a variety of project types.
I have laid ground for new sites, setting up CI/CD and establishing early project file structure and coding standards.
I have worked on more long-term projects, providing support and maintenance for existing applications.
I am comfortable wearing many different hats in a team and am confident that I will be a productive member no matter my role.

Lastly, every good frontend developer should have an understanding of the entire stack.
When I encounter a bug in the backend, I don't hesitate to crack open my IDE and see what's going on.
From fixing slow SQL queries to adding a needed endpoint, I consider everything to be in my wheelhouse.

In conclusion, I am excited for the opportunity to collaborate with the University of Chicago.
I appreciate your consideration and look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Adam Hammes
