To the Motley Fool,

I'm a sucker for funky domain names, and "fool.com" definitely qualifies.
I came across your open frontend web developer developer on LinkedIn and liked the personality that the job description displayed.

What can I offer you?

- More than three years of full-stack web development experience
- An insatiable curiosity, both professionally and personally - I learned French while working in Quebec!
- A commitment to effective communication, whether that be through pair programming or written documentation

To wrap up things, have one of my favorite jokes:

> The English football team visited an orphanage in Russia last week.
> "It was heart breaking to see their little faces with no hope", said Vladimir, aged 6.

Warmest regards,

Adam Hammes
