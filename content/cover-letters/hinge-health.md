Dear Hiring Manager,

It is with genuine enthusiasm that I submit my application for the position of full-stack software engineer at Hinge Health.
As a full-stack developer with close to four years of professional experience, I know that my diverse skill set will make me an asset to the team.

One of my defining qualities is tenacious problem-solving.
When I reworked our application's PDF rendering system, it wasn't with a single "silver bullet" change, but rather a series of small iterative improvements:

- Rigorous profiling led me to pinpoint slow splots in the rendering pipeline
- Faster PDF generation allowed the front-end to substitute long-polling for a single HTTP call
- Perusing documentation turned up a method to modify PDF templates without recompiling

The result?
Improved performance for our customers, as well as a vastly better dev experience.

Clear communication has also played a key role in my career.
When our designer remarked that a lot of visual inconsistencies were slipping through code review, I sat down with him to write a cheat sheet of his design process.
I presented that document to the front-end team, and we were able to more consistently nail those pixel-perfect designs.

Lastly, from a more technical perspective, Jamstack is my jam (yes, I'm known for my bad puns).
When I last moved, I built a site to help search through the apartments on the market.
The site was a static Gatsby application, generated daily through a cron job.
This architecture allowed the site to scale to hundreds of daily users and thousands of apartments, all without having to scale a single server.

In conclusion, I am excited for the opportunity to join Hinge Health in revolutionizing musculoskeletal care.
I appreciate your consideration and look forward to hearing from you.

Warmest regards,

Adam Hammes
