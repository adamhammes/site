Dear Imperfect Foods,

I came across your position of full stack software engineer on Y Combinator's monthly "Who is hiring?" thread, and the company's description caught my eye.
I was taught the three Rs of environmentalism in school: reduce, reuse, and recycle, with reduce being the most effective.
I appreciate Imperfect Food's commitment to reducing food waste and would love to contribute towards that mission.

What can I offer you?

- More than three years of industry web development experience and a high level of comfort with React, Typescript, and the .NET stack
- An insatiable curiosity, both professionally and personally - I learned French while working in Quebec!
- A commitment to excellence in my work, whether this be performance, user experience, or accessibility

I appreciate your consideration for the position and look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Adam Hammes
