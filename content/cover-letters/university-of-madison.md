Dear Hiring Manager,

<!-- inspiration: https://www.askamanager.org/2014/02/heres-a-real-life-example-of-a-great-cover-letter-with-before-and-after-versions.html -->

It is with genuine enthusiasm that I submit my application for the position of Developer at Wisconsin Geological and Natural History.
As a full-stack developer who has worked professionally on a variety of software
projects, I know that my diverse skill set will make me an asset to the
department.

As you will see from my included resume, I've built my career working on
all parts of web development, from optimizing SQL queries to building out
single-page applications.
Through all of this, one thing has remained constant: My thirst for knowledge.
No matter what I'm working on, you can be assured that I will always be exploring and pushing myself to learn more.

One area of software development that has always fascinated me is geographic information systems.
When I was apartment-searching for my first job, I plunged head-first into the domain by scraping local apartment offers and dynamically displaying them with a React/Leaflet frontend.
After I found lodging for myself, I continued supporting the site, and it's since been used by apartment-seekers throughout Quebec.

I am thrilled at the opportunity to work with the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey.
I appreciate your consideration and look forward to hearing from you.

Warmest regards,

Adam Hammes
