Dear Dropbox,

I am delighted to apply for your position of software engineer.
I've been a loyal user of your product for almost a decade now.
When I came across your tech blog - in particular, the post "Rewriting the heart of our sync engine" - I was impressed by the engineering discipline depicted and went looking for your open jobs.

What can I offer Dropbox?

- More than three years of full-stack web development experience
- An insatiable curiosity, both professionally and personally - I learned French while working in Quebec!
- A commitment to effective communication, whether that be through pair programming or written documentation

I am excited for the opportunity to work on a product I've used for so long, and appreciate your consideration for the position.

Sincerely,

Adam Hammes
