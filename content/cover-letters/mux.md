Dear Mux,

I am genuinely excited to apply to your open position of UI engineer.
I recently came across your company's "Show HN" post on Hacker News, and was impressed by the humbleness and enthousiasm displayed by your engineers.
As a frontend web developer with three year's experience, I know my skills would make me an asset to the company.

What can I bring to Mux?

- A passion for developer experience.
  If someone mentions in a daily that X part of the codebase is a pain to work with, you can bet your britches that I'll be digging into why and looking for avenues of improvement.
- A focus on web fundamentals.
  Too often, developers reach for Javascript when CSS or HTML could do the same job.
  Recently, I've been playing around with using the "details" tag to implement accordions.
- An obsession with performance.
  From digging into why a SQL query is sluggish to looking at flamegraphs in Chrome's profiler, I'm willing to use any tool at hand to squeeze out the last ounce of speed.

I appreciate your consideration, and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Adam Hammes
