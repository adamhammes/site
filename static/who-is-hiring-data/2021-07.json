Or at least that's the idea. We're involved in a broad range of activities[1], but the big picture is a global conversation about climate change.\n\nOur current go-to is a research effort called the Great Reef Census[2], currently in its second year. The project incorporates a whole range of (relatively lo-fi / glue-together yet novel) tech solutions, from remote / vessel-deployed offline servers, spatially aware data submission portals, 3d planning tools[3] (we like mapping), plus an ML/CV angle being developed from last year's data. It's an open project, so all data is being released under CC, similarly code open sourced (as soon as time permits). Everything we can build in house we do. We need an extra pair of hands for delivery of the project this year.\n\nOur stack is primarily vue / node (db is firestore, cloud gcp / cloudflare) so best case would be someone with a solid web pedigree. At the same time we do a lot of data-wrangling, and our edge servers could do with some devops love and automation (ubuntu / netplan (captive wifi w public dns + 4g) / haproxy / more). We also need to prepare the project for open sourcing, to drive further tech engagement and resource. If your skills lend themselves to any of this, it would free up hands.\n\nWe are busy and under resourced and find it difficult to recruit / compete in the current landscape. That said, we're willing to accommodate any measures that would make it work for the right person. Tech is currently a one-person show. The role would likely suit a senior type with some days spare and a passion for the environment. It is a paid position.

To achieve this, we wrote a little functional DSL that's now in production. Type inference of returns and parameters using inequality constraints is in a feature branch and there is plenty more to do on the language itself as well as the ecosystem around it. SIL can compile and call C++ and D at runtime; Python interop is in alpha; and C# is on the way. What might be a project in itself elsewhere can be just a set of functions in Symmetry Integration Language.\n\nThe language is written in D and we have a close involvement with the D Foundation and community, hosting DConf in London. So we are looking for outstanding native code developers who would like to write D as well as people to work with practitioners writing Symmetry Integration Language. Also looking for people to write documentation and work on the build.\n\nIt's quite a creative place where we encourage a degree of courage amidst practical constraints, and we are open to doing things a different way if it's commercially sound and in the interests of our investors.\n\nWe look for virtues and capabilities over only experience and credentials although those things aren't a disadvantage. Do not let a lack of credentials or qualifications prevent you from applying. We've recently hired experts with C++, Common Lisp, D, Haxe, Haskell, Julia and Perl backgrounds, and are happy to bring them up to speed with the tools we use.\n\nCompensation is currently not quite at Netflix standards but is generous to very generous over time by broad technology industry standards.
