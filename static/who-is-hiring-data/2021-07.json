Or at least that&#x27;s the idea. We&#x27;re involved in a broad range of activities[1], but the big picture is a global conversation about climate change.<p>Our current go-to is a research effort called the Great Reef Census[2], currently in its second year. The project incorporates a whole range of (relatively lo-fi &#x2F; glue-together yet novel) tech solutions, from remote &#x2F; vessel-deployed offline servers, spatially aware data submission portals, 3d planning tools[3] (we like mapping), plus an ML&#x2F;CV angle being developed from last year&#x27;s data. It&#x27;s an open project, so all data is being released under CC, similarly code open sourced (as soon as time permits). Everything we can build in house we do. We need an extra pair of hands for delivery of the project this year.<p>Our stack is primarily vue &#x2F; node (db is firestore, cloud gcp &#x2F; cloudflare) so best case would be someone with a solid web pedigree. At the same time we do a lot of data-wrangling, and our edge servers could do with some devops love and automation (ubuntu &#x2F; netplan (captive wifi w public dns + 4g) &#x2F; haproxy &#x2F; more). We also need to prepare the project for open sourcing, to drive further tech engagement and resource. If your skills lend themselves to any of this, it would free up hands.<p>We are busy and under resourced and find it difficult to recruit &#x2F; compete in the current landscape. That said, we&#x27;re willing to accommodate any measures that would make it work for the right person. Tech is currently a one-person show. The role would likely suit a senior type with some days spare and a passion for the environment. It is a paid position. If you&#x27;re local (or want to relocate to Cairns) we also do a lot of diving and there&#x27;s the opportunity to certify &amp; spend some solid time on the reef as part of the project.<p>Role: Casual over 3-6mths+ (what can you do, how long will it take) &#x2F; flexible schedule to suit budget (we value skill set over availability) &#x2F; no juniors, interns at this stage unfortunately.<p>Questions &#x2F; expressions of interest to hq@citizensgbr.org ~ Thanks!<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;citizensgbr.org&#x2F;explore&#x2F;atlas\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;citizensgbr.org&#x2F;explore&#x2F;atlas</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greatreefcensus.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greatreefcensus.org</a>\n[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lab.citizensgbr.org&#x2F;census-map&#x2F;v2&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lab.citizensgbr.org&#x2F;census-map&#x2F;v2&#x2F;</a>"}, {"id": 27706753, "author": "bjchartier", "html_content": "MaxMine | Senior Software Engineer, Web Full Stack &amp; Streaming Analytics | REMOTE (Aus-only) or Adelaide, South Australia<p>MaxMine is a technology scale-up pushing the limits of data analytics to optimise our client\u2019s operations.

That should give you an idea both about how seriously we take technology and the culture of the firm.<p>We are four years into a period of transformation from what was initially a fairly standard enterprise finance technology approach to something new that recognises the importance of both the humane and the technical for discretionary portfolio management and for the business of running an alternative investment manager.

To achieve this, we wrote a little functional DSL that&#x27;s now in production. Type inference of returns and parameters using inequality constraints is in a feature branch and there is plenty more to do on the language itself as well as the ecosystem around it. SIL can compile and call C++ and D at runtime; Python interop is in alpha; and C# is on the way.  What might be a project in itself elsewhere can be just a set of functions in Symmetry Integration Language.<p>The language is written in D and we have a close involvement with the D Foundation and community, hosting DConf in London.  So we are looking for outstanding native code developers who would like to write D as well as people to work with practitioners writing Symmetry Integration Language. Also looking for people to write documentation and work on the build.<p>It&#x27;s quite a creative place where we encourage a degree of courage amidst practical constraints, and we are open to doing things a different way if it&#x27;s commercially sound and in the interests of our investors.<p>We look for virtues and capabilities over only experience and credentials although those things aren&#x27;t a disadvantage. Do not let a lack of credentials or qualifications prevent you from applying. We&#x27;ve recently hired experts with C++, Common Lisp, D, Haxe, Haskell, Julia and Perl backgrounds, and are happy to bring them up to speed with the tools we use.<p>Compensation is currently not quite at Netflix standards but is generous to very generous over time by broad technology industry standards.
